Fotag!

This is a program for giving ratings for pictures. Users can load images, and display the images and metadata in a dynamic layout. Users can rate images, and filter them based on the rating.

This program is developed on Windows platform, and by Java10.

Tips of using the program:
- You can change the layout (grid layout or list layout) by clicking the buttons on the top left.
- By clicking "Load Images" button, you can choose your local images and load them into the program. You can load several images at the same time.
- After loading an image, the name of the image and its creation date will be shown either below the image (grid layout) or at the left of the iamge (list view).
- You can rate each image (from 1 to 5) by clicking stars.
- By using the Filter in toolbar, you can filter the images based on the rating you gave.
- To change the rating of an image, just click a star that is different from the current rating. For example, if the image currently has rating 4, and you can change it to rating 2 by clicking the second star.
- To clear the rating you gave to an image, click the star with the current rating. For example, if the current rating is 2, click the second star again to clear the rating.
- The same approach applies to filter if you want to change the filter value, or clear the filter value.
- Clicking on an image enlarges it in a separate window.
- When first executed, the program shows an empty window. 
- When exiting the program, images and metadata are saved, so that on relaunch, the same images are automatically shown.
